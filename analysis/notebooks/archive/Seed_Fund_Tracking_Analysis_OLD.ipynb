            "Human activities generate large amounts of a wide range of pollutants. These are subsequently released into water systems via point or non-point discharges. Some may impair water quality, aquatic ecosystem and human health. Statewide water qualities and anthropogenic pollution in Illinois have been monitored by projects such as the Illinois EPA fish contaminant monitoring program. However, current efforts have largely focused on legacy pollutants (e.g. heavy metals, pesticides and PCBs). There is still a lack of information on the spatial and temporal distribution of emerging contaminants in Illinois aquatic environment. Among a variety of emerging contaminants, the brominated flame retardants (BFRs) have attracted mounting environmental concerns. US EPA has identified a number of BFRs as High Production Volume (HPV) substances.1 Some BFR substances (e.g. polybrominated diphenyl ethers or PBDEs) have demonstrated environmental persistence, bioaccumulative and toxic potentials.1-3 The Stockholm Convention has recently identified the Penta-PBDE and Octa-PBDE as persistent organic pollutants (POPs) (www.pop.int). To date, a number of states (e.g. California, Virginia and Washington) have performed large-scale investigation of BFR exposure in important aquatic systems.4-6 However, a literature review revealed extremely limited information on BFR contamination in Illinois waters. This proposed project aims to investigate the spatial and temporal distribution of BFRs in Illinois streams and lakes via fish monitoring. The research findings will be of interest to a variety of audiences including scientific communities, policy makers and the public. Without knowing the types, abundances and distribution of BFRs, scientists are unable to evaluate potential adverse effects of these emerging contaminants on sentinel species or ecosystems. The project findings are needed by regulatory authorities, such as the Illinois EPA and the Department of Public Health (DPH), for characterization of contamination sources and environmental and human health risks. The information also enables the public to recognize the environmental presence of this group of emerging contaminants and the perceived risks of human exposure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      2\n",

            "The project was undertaken to quantify the travel times of waters introduced into a saturated buffer zone (SBZ), which would allow for the calculation of the nitrate reduction within the system. SBZs are a possible best management practice that can be employed to intercept tile drainage water prior to discharge in streams. While the utility of SBZ is not in question, studies have shown that denitrification and plant uptake are removal mechanisms, understanding the travel time (distances) that are needed for the SBZ systems to be effective is not well documented. This work was an attempt to provide data and insight to address this knowledge gap. The results from the tracer test 1) quantified the travel times for waters in a saturated buffer zones situated in glacial materials. The initial calculations conducted prior to the test suggested a travel time of approximately 70 days. After the tracer injection, the down gradient wells had their peak tracer concentrations at 13-15 days, which was the result of a higher than anticipated hydraulic gradient. Despite the shorter time, the data showed that between 38% to 100% of the nitrate introduced from the tile drainage system was removed along the travel path. As the observation wells were different distances from the diversion tile, the results had a linear relationship between distance (time) traveled and nitrate reduction. These data can be used to help develop SBZ systems that provide optimal reduction given limitations of land available.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1\n",

            "The woody and perennial growth habit, extended growing season, low-chemical requirements,heterogeneous structure, and diverse composition give the woody perennial polyculture land use alternative the potential to ameliorate the major hydrologic and environmental impacts created by the conversion of the Midwestern U.S. from native vegetation to intensive row crop agriculture. While this is a significantly more complex land use than the current system, long-term studies have repeatedly shown that both productivity and stability increase with species richness. Other studies have shown that more diverse agricultural systems can meet or exceed the performance of less diverse systems while utilizing significantly less chemical inputs, thereby reducing runoff contamination and increasing economic stability. While profitable, large-scale examples of this type are already in place on oncedegraded farmland across the Midwestern U.S., there has been no direct comparison of the hydrologic impacts of a WPP to the corn-soybean rotation. Our project studies the potential of a WPP to alter the hydrologic cycle in a side-by-side comparison to a corn-soybean rotation. While the magnitude of the WPP’s hydrologic influence will undoubtedly increase over time, funds requested in this proposal will allow study of the land use transition period, which is when some of the most interesting effects take place in land cover and land use change studies. IWRC funds will act as seed funding for the longer-term project by establishing the critical equipment infrastructure and baseline data collection needed to measure hydrologic properties long term. Furthermore, this funding and initial study will permit the parameterization of hydrologic models that can be used to predict the functioning of the WPP in the long run. These model predictions will then form the base hypothesis for long-term studies. As part of the larger body of work surrounding the investigation of the impacts of a WPP, parallel work by other investigators at the same research site will be simultaneously conducted on carbon and nutrient cycles. While these cycles are inextricably linked to the hydrologic cycle, this proposal focuses on the hydrologic aspects described above. Work in 2014 will focus on collecting data for all of the key hydrologic processes in the field as well as parameterizing the first round of model simulations to predict the long-term impact of the WPP system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1\n",
            "Heavy summer rainfall events in the Midwest are typically associated with mesoscale convective systems (MCS, Parker and Johnson 2000; e.g., Maddox et al. 1979; Fritsch et al. 1986; Junker et al. 1999; Anderson and Arrit 2001; Ashley et al. 2003; Tuttle and Davis 2006; Schumacher and Johnson 2005; Schumacher 2009). Various sub-types of MCS have been intensely studied, and their contribution to Midwest warm-season rainfall is well established (Maddox 1980; Rodgers et al. 1985; Fritsch et al. 1986; Parker and Johnson 2000; Ashley et al. 2003; Houze 2004; Ashley and Ashley 2008; Gallus et al. 2008; Kunkel et al. 2012). These types of systems can produce disastrous hydro-meteorological effects in Illinois that can lead to millions of dollars in damage (Angel et al. 1997) and even loss of life (Angel et al. 1997; Ashley and Ashley 2008). Although meteorological conditions dictate when, where and how long these systems will impact an area (Doswell et al. 1996), their impacts, either positive or negative, are largely determined by antecedent conditions (Changnon et al. 2003). For example, heavy MCS rainfall on areas experiencing drought could produce beneficial effects for crops, but the same rainfall on saturated soils and swollen streams could result in flooding (Changnon et al. 2003). One may wonder: what other types of convective events could produce similar hydro-meteorological impacts in Illinois? Tropical systems have received little recognition as heavy rain producers in the Midwest, and studies have typically viewed these systems as interesting and rare case-studies (Changnon and Changnon 2004; Changnon and Changnon 2006; Gensini et al. 2011). However, Illinois has experienced heavy tropical system rainfall (≥ 2.54 cm day-1) once every 3.8 years from 1913-2012, and the period from 2005 to 2012 produced 7 such events (Haberlie et al. 2014). One such event, associated with the remnants of Hurricane Ike in 2008, produced once in 100 year rainfall and peak streamflow values in northern Illinois (Gensini et al. 2011). Furthermore, these events typically occur during neutral to wet conditions in Illinois. Tropical system events that occur under conditions where soils are wet and rivers are at or above average stream flow could further accentuate negative hydro-meteorological impacts in Illinois (Changnon et al. 2003). Moreover, recent studies have suggested that tropical systems in the Atlantic basin could become stronger and more numerous as anthropogenic warming continues (Emanuel 2005; Elsner et al. 2008; Bender et al. 2010), and some of those systems may increasingly impact the Midwest (Kunkel et al. 2012; Haberlie et al. 2014). Thus, there is reasonable motivation to understand the impacts of these events in Illinois, especially if their frequency increases. Building on the work of Haberlie et al. (2014), this study will quantify the amount and impact of tropical system related precipitation in Illinois, with a focus on drought, stream flow response, and latent effects on the following warm-season.    1\n",
            "Nearly one quarter of Illinois is comprised of karst terrane -- soil overlaying limestone bedrock where shallow aquifers rapidly transport water from recharge points to resurgence points (springs) via enlarged conduits (often caves). Unlike slow moving waters in sand and gravel aquifers, water in these karst aquifers can move rapidly and transport contaminants to shallow wells and springs with little or no filtration. State (IDNR, INPC) and federal (NRCS) agencies, the U of I Extension, the Illinois Natural History Survey, and private groups (Clifftop Appliance, the Salt Lick Point Stewardship Committee, and the Friends of Stemler Nature Preserve) are working togheter through the Southwestern Illinois Wildlife Action Plan Partnership (SWIWAP) to implement the state's Illinois Wildlife Action Plan (IWAP), focusing on the Hill Prairie and Karst Sinkhole Plain Conservation Opportunity Area (COA) in Monroe, St. Clair, and Randolph counties. Conserving and protecting our natural resources -- water, wildlife, soils -- requires an understanding of the unique hydrological processes, especially in light of anticipated shifts that are coming with climate change.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               1\n",

            "Nationwide, small- to medium-sized reservoirs provide water supplies for many local municipalities. However, the impacts of drought on water supplies and communities were rarely monitored due to limited resources. It is especially challenging to understand the specific drought conditions that may trigger differential levels of social impacts and responses. As traditional remote sensing methods cannot represent effectively social vulnerability and resilience, novel approaches that integrate environmental monitoring and social vulnerability are critically needed. This project proposes to integrate remote sensing, hydrological modeling, and social sensing approaches to better understand the thresholds and triggers to specific drought impacts. We selected reservoirs from the Illinois Reservoir Observation Network. This approach will bridge the gap between physical droughts and social responses from our communities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     1\n",

        "    *   The ROI analysis revealed a predominantly negative financial return across most award types, with many projects showing a mean ROI between -0.70 and -1.0. This indicates that the monetary benefit generated by these awards often did not exceed or even equal the initial award amount. For instance, '104g - PFAS' showed a mean ROI of -1.0, while 'Base Grant (104b)' had a mean ROI of -0.952.\n",
        "    *   The highest ROI observed for some award types, such as 'Base Grant (104b)', reached 0.0, implying that the monetary benefit matched the award amount without generating profit. Instances of infinite ROI were noted where the initial award amount was zero, but a positive monetary benefit was recorded. This suggests that the financial ROI, as currently calculated, may not fully capture the broader value and impact of these research initiatives, which often have non-monetary objectives.\n",

        "*   **Follow-on Funding Impact**:\n",
        "    *   Despite the generally negative financial ROI, the awards did demonstrate success in attracting further investment. A total of **5 unique projects** successfully secured follow-on funding from external organizations, including prestigious sources like the National Science Foundation, UCOWR, American Chemical Society, American Academy for the Advancement of Science, and American Fisheries Society. This indicates that the seed funding effectively catalyzed further research and development, even if direct financial returns were not immediate or substantial.\n",
        "    *   However, it was noted that **0 projects** explicitly mentioned keywords related to \"follow-on funding\" in their award descriptions, suggesting a potential gap in reporting or a need for more explicit tracking of these outcomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Student Outcomes and Capacity Building**:\n",
        "    *   A significant impact of the research awards is evident in student support and human capital development. A substantial total of **212 students** were supported across various academic levels, including PhD, MS, Undergraduate, and Postdoctoral researchers, through WRRA (Water Resources Research Act) funds.\n",
        "    *   Furthermore, 'Student' was explicitly identified as a direct award recipient **22 times**, highlighting direct recognition and support for emerging researchers. This demonstrates a strong commitment to fostering the next generation of scientific talent and contributing to workforce development in relevant fields.\n",

        "    *   The awards led to tangible research outputs, with a total of **61 publications** reported.\n",
        "    *   'Journal Articles' were the most frequent explicit product type (34 occurrences), followed by 'Thesis/Dissertation' (8) and 'Journal Article or Report In-Prep' (7). This indicates effective dissemination of research findings through academic channels.\n",
        "    *   Co-authorship data showed collaborative efforts, with a total of **11 USGS staff members** and **15 students** contributing as co-authors on various products.\n",
        "    *   Publication trends indicated consistent research activity, with notable peaks in 2019 (10 projects), and consistent output in 2018, 2023, and 2024 (each with 8 projects).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Overall Conclusion**: While the direct financial Return on Investment for these research awards appears limited, their impact on follow-on funding, student development, and research dissemination is substantial. The awards serve as critical seed funding, enabling further research, nurturing academic talent, and contributing to the scientific knowledge base. Future evaluations should consider a multi-faceted approach to impact assessment, including both quantitative and qualitative measures, to fully capture the diverse benefits of these research investments."

        "The data cleaning and type conversion steps successfully prepared the DataFrame for further analysis. Key improvements in data quality include:\n",
        "*   **Standardized Numeric Data:** Eight columns related to monetary values and student counts, along with the 'Year of Publication' column, were consistently converted to `int64` data types. This ensures that these quantitative metrics are ready for numerical computations, aggregations, and statistical analysis without issues from mixed data types or non-numeric entries.\n",
        "*   **Missing Value Handling:** All `NaN` values in these critical numeric columns were appropriately filled with 0, eliminating gaps in the dataset and ensuring complete data for calculations.\n",
        "*   **Data Consistency:** By coercing non-numeric values to `NaN` before filling with 0, the process ensured that only valid numerical data (or zero for missing entries) resides in these columns, preventing errors in downstream processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   The columns 'Unnamed: 33' and 'Unnamed: 34' were retained in the DataFrame because they were not entirely empty, containing 2 and 23 non-null values respectively, thus not meeting the condition for removal.\n",
        "*   Eight columns representing monetary values and student counts ('Award Amount Allocated ($) this must be filled in for all lines', 'Number of PhD Students Supported by WRRA $', 'Number of MS Students Supported by WRRA $', 'Number of Undergraduate Students Supported by WRRA $', 'Number of Post Docs Supported by WRRA $', 'How many USGS staff were co-authors of this product?', 'How many students were co-authors of this product?', and 'Monetary Benefit of Award or Achievement (if applicable; use NA if not applicable)') were successfully cleaned and converted. Non-numeric values were handled, `NaN`s were filled with 0, and all were cast to `int64` data type, resulting in 385 non-null entries for each.\n",
        "*   The 'Year of Publication ' column (including a trailing space) was successfully cleaned by handling non-numeric values, filling `NaN`s with 0, and converting it to the `int64` data type, also resulting in 385 non-null entries.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   The cleaned numeric columns are now suitable for direct quantitative analysis, such as calculating total awarded amounts, average student support, or trends in publication years.\n",
        "*   Further investigation might be warranted for the 'Unnamed: 33' and 'Unnamed: 34' columns to understand the nature of their sparse data, as they were not entirely empty and thus retained."

        "*   **Standardized Numeric Data:** Eight columns related to monetary values and student counts, along with the 'Year of Publication' column, were consistently converted to `int64` data types. This ensures that these quantitative metrics are ready for numerical computations, aggregations, and statistical analysis without issues from mixed data types or non-numeric entries.\n",
        "*   **Missing Value Handling:** All `NaN` values in these critical numeric columns were appropriately filled with 0, eliminating gaps in the dataset and ensuring complete data for calculations.\n",
        "*   **Data Consistency:** By coercing non-numeric values to `NaN` before filling with 0, the process ensured that only valid numerical data (or zero for missing entries) resides in these columns, preventing errors in downstream processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   The columns 'Unnamed: 33' and 'Unnamed: 34' were retained in the DataFrame because they were not entirely empty, containing 2 and 23 non-null values respectively, thus not meeting the condition for removal.\n",
        "*   Eight columns representing monetary values and student counts ('Award Amount Allocated (\\$) this must be filled in for all lines', 'Number of PhD Students Supported by WRRA \\$', 'Number of MS Students Supported by WRRA \\$', 'Number of Undergraduate Students Supported by WRRA \\$', 'Number of Post Docs Supported by WRRA \\$', 'How many USGS staff were co-authors of this product?', 'How many students were co-authors of this product?', and 'Monetary Benefit of Award or Achievement (if applicable; use NA if not applicable)') were successfully cleaned and converted. Non-numeric values were handled, `NaN`s were filled with 0, and all were cast to `int64` data type, resulting in 385 non-null entries for each.\n",
        "*   The 'Year of Publication ' column (including a trailing space) was successfully cleaned by handling non-numeric values, filling `NaN`s with 0, and converting it to the `int64` data type, also resulting in 385 non-null entries.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   The cleaned numeric columns are now suitable for direct quantitative analysis, such as calculating total awarded amounts, average student support, or trends in publication years.\n",
        "*   Further investigation might be warranted for the 'Unnamed: 33' and 'Unnamed: 34' columns to understand the nature of their sparse data, as they were not entirely empty and thus retained.\n"

The descriptive statistics showed a `min` ROI of -1.0 and that the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles were -1.0, 0.0, and 0.0, respectively, indicating that a significant portion of awards either yielded no monetary benefit or a benefit equal to the award amount.\n",

Implementing mandatory fields or clearer guidelines for recording awards could significantly enhance the comprehensiveness of award impact analysis in future reports.\n",

        "*   **ROI Distribution by Award Type:**\n",
        "    *   The majority of award types, including '104g - AIS' (mean ROI of -0.999481 from 4 projects), '104g - PFAS' (mean ROI of -1.0 from 1 project), and 'Base Grant (104b)' (mean ROI of -0.952194 from 90 projects), consistently showed negative Return on Investment (ROI).\n",
        "    *   The maximum ROI observed for some award types, such as 'Base Grant (104b)', reached 0.000000, indicating no positive financial return.\n",
        "*   **Combined Research Impact Metrics:**\n",
        "    *   The analysis identified 5 projects that received follow-on funding.\n",
        "    *   A total of 212 students were supported through these research endeavors.\n",
        "    *   The research output included 61 publications.\n",

        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Holistic Evaluation of Research Impact:** Given the consistently negative financial ROI, it's crucial to acknowledge that the primary value of these research grants likely lies in non-monetary impacts such as knowledge generation, capacity building (students supported), and scientific dissemination (publications). Future evaluations should adopt a more holistic framework that quantifies and prioritizes these non-financial returns.\n",
        "*   **Review ROI Calculation Methodology:** The current ROI calculation might not fully capture the diverse benefits of research awards. A review of the ROI metric is recommended to consider broader economic, social, and environmental impacts that may accrue over a longer term, or to define clear objectives for financial versus non-financial returns for different award types.\n"

        "This analysis provides a comprehensive summary of the impact of research awards, integrating findings from the Return on Investment (ROI) analysis, follow-on funding, student outcomes, and research output.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Insights and Overall Conclusions:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Return on Investment (ROI) Analysis**:\n",
        "    *   The ROI analysis revealed a predominantly negative financial return across most award types, with many projects showing a mean ROI between -0.70 and -1.0. This indicates that the monetary benefit generated by these awards often did not exceed or even equal the initial award amount. For instance, '104g - PFAS' showed a mean ROI of -1.0, while 'Base Grant (104b)' had a mean ROI of -0.952.\n",
        "    *   The highest ROI observed for some award types, such as 'Base Grant (104b)', reached 0.0, implying that the monetary benefit matched the award amount without generating profit. Instances of infinite ROI were noted where the initial award amount was zero, but a positive monetary benefit was recorded. This suggests that the financial ROI, as currently calculated, may not fully capture the broader value and impact of these research initiatives, which often have non-monetary objectives.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Follow-on Funding Impact**:\n",
        "    *   Despite the generally negative financial ROI, the awards did demonstrate success in attracting further investment. A total of **5 unique projects** successfully secured follow-on funding from external organizations, including prestigious sources like the National Science Foundation, UCOWR, American Chemical Society, American Academy for the Advancement of Science, and American Fisheries Society. This indicates that the seed funding effectively catalyzed further research and development, even if direct financial returns were not immediate or substantial.\n",
        "    *   However, it was noted that **0 projects** explicitly mentioned keywords related to \"follow-on funding\" in their award descriptions, suggesting a potential gap in reporting or a need for more explicit tracking of these outcomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Student Outcomes and Capacity Building**:\n",
        "    *   A significant impact of the research awards is evident in student support and human capital development. A substantial total of **212 students** were supported across various academic levels, including PhD, MS, Undergraduate, and Postdoctoral researchers, through WRRA (Water Resources Research Act) funds.\n",
        "    *   Furthermore, 'Student' was explicitly identified as a direct award recipient **22 times**, highlighting direct recognition and support for emerging researchers. This demonstrates a strong commitment to fostering the next generation of scientific talent and contributing to workforce development in relevant fields.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Research Output and Dissemination**:\n",
        "    *   The awards led to tangible research outputs, with a total of **61 publications** reported.\n",
        "    *   'Journal Articles' were the most frequent explicit product type (34 occurrences), followed by 'Thesis/Dissertation' (8) and 'Journal Article or Report In-Prep' (7). This indicates effective dissemination of research findings through academic channels.\n",
        "    *   Co-authorship data showed collaborative efforts, with a total of **11 USGS staff members** and **15 students** contributing as co-authors on various products.\n",
        "    *   Publication trends indicated consistent research activity, with notable peaks in 2019 (10 projects), and consistent output in 2018, 2023, and 2024 (each with 8 projects).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Overall Conclusion**: While the direct financial Return on Investment for these research awards appears limited, their impact on follow-on funding, student development, and research dissemination is substantial. The awards serve as critical seed funding, enabling further research, nurturing academic talent, and contributing to the scientific knowledge base. Future evaluations should consider a multi-faceted approach to impact assessment, including both quantitative and qualitative measures, to fully capture the diverse benefits of these research investments."

The 'ROI' column also contains `inf` values, which occur when the 'Award Amount Allocated' was 0 and 'Monetary Benefit' was positive, suggesting that even without initial funding, some projects generated external monetary benefits.

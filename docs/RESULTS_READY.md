### **Key Talking Points**

Use these exact numbers in your one-pager:

✅ **"$8.5 million invested in water research over 10 years"**

✅ **"304 students trained in water resources science"**
- 118 PhD students
- 52 Master's students
- 127 Undergraduate students
- 7 Post-doctoral researchers

✅ **"At least $275,000 in documented follow-on funding secured"**
- *Important*: Add caveat that this is a minimum based on reported data
- Actual ROI likely higher with complete reporting

✅ **"IWRC serves multiple institutions across Illinois"**
- Demonstrates statewide impact
- Not just UIUC

---

## ⚠️ Important Context for Stakeholders

### Why ROI Appears Low (0.032x)

The ROI calculation shows a low multiplier because:

1. **Only ~5% reporting rate**: Just 10 out of 220 projects have documented follow-on funding amounts
2. **Many researchers secured grants but didn't report them** in the tracking system
3. **Some entries have descriptions but no dollar values**

### What to Emphasize

✅ **Student training is your strongest metric** (304 students - concrete and verified)

✅ **Follow-on funding of $275K is a MINIMUM** (actual amount likely much higher)

✅ **Geographic diversity** shows IWRC serves all of Illinois

✅ **Sustained investment** of $8.5M demonstrates long-term commitment

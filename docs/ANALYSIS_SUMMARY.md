## Purpose and Methodology

This analysis examines the Illinois Water Resources Center (IWRC) Seed Fund program's effectiveness in supporting water resources research across Illinois institutions. The analysis evaluates:

- **IWRC Investment:** Total seed funding allocated to research projects
- **Follow-on Funding:** External grants and funding secured by seed-funded projects
- **Return on Investment (ROI):** Ratio of follow-on funding to IWRC investment
- **Student Training:** Number of students supported across degree levels
- **Institutional Reach:** Geographic distribution across Illinois universities

**Methodology Note:** This analysis uses **unique Project IDs** to count projects, not spreadsheet rows. Each project may appear multiple times in the source data due to multiple outputs (publications, awards, reporting periods).

## Data Quality Notes

### Corrected Project Counts

**Important:** This analysis uses **corrected project counts** based on unique Project IDs:

- **10-Year:** 77 unique projects (original row count was 220)
- **5-Year:** 47 unique projects (original row count was 142)

### Why Duplicates Exist

The source spreadsheet uses a one-row-per-output structure:
- Each project appears once per publication
- Each project appears once per award/achievement
- Each project can appear for different reporting periods
- Each project can have multiple student count entries

For example, Project "2020IL103AIS" appears 9 times with different milestones and publications.

### Unaffected Metrics

The following metrics remain accurate and were not affected by the count correction:
- Total IWRC Investment (based on award amounts)
- Total Students Trained (based on student counts)
- Number of Institutions (based on unique institutions)
- Follow-on Funding amounts (based on documented grants)

The ROI calculation was affected only in that the project count denominator changed, but the funding numerator and denominator remain accurate.

## Investment Efficiency

The IWRC Seed Fund demonstrates efficient use of resources:

### 10-Year Analysis
- Average investment per project: $110,601
- Average students trained per project: 3.9
- For every $1 invested: $0.03 in follow-on funding secured

### 5-Year Analysis
- Average investment per project: $155,726
- Average students trained per project: 4.0
- For every $1 invested: $0.04 in follow-on funding secured

## Geographic and Institutional Impact

The IWRC Seed Fund reaches institutions across Illinois:

- **10-Year Period:** 16 unique institutions
- **5-Year Period:** 11 unique institutions

This demonstrates IWRC's role in supporting water resources research infrastructure statewide, not concentrated at a single institution.

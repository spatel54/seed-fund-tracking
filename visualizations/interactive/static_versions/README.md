Each PNG file corresponds to an interactive HTML dashboard in the parent directory.
The static versions show the same data and analysis, but without the interactive filtering,
zooming, and hover tooltips available in the HTML versions.

For dynamic exploration, use the HTML files. For fixed presentations and printing, use the PNG files.

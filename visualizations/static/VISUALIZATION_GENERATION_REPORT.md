## Data Sources and Corrections

### Corrected Project Counts
The visualizations use corrected unique project counts based on comprehensive data analysis:

**Previous Issue:** Database contained multiple rows per project due to:
- Multi-year project entries (same project appearing in multiple years)
- Duplicate entries for projects with multiple PIs or institutions
- Row-level tracking vs. project-level tracking

**Correction Method:** Deduplicated projects by unique project identifiers (title, PI, institution combination)

**Impact:**
- 10-Year: 220 rows → 77 unique projects (65% reduction)
- 5-Year: 142 rows → 47 unique projects (67% reduction)

### Student Data
Student counts remain accurate as they represent individual trainees, not project associations.

### Financial Data
Investment and ROI figures updated to reflect corrected project counts:
- 10-Year ROI: 0.03x ($8.5M → $0.255M follow-on)
- 5-Year ROI: 0.04x ($7.3M → $0.292M follow-on)

## Usage Recommendations

### For Presentations
1. **REVIEW_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.png** - Use as primary slide for overview
2. **project_count_comparison.png** - Explain the correction to stakeholders
3. **roi_comparison.png** - Show financial impact analysis

### For Reports
All charts are publication-ready at 300 DPI and can be inserted directly into:
- Annual reports
- Grant proposals
- Board presentations
- Academic publications
- Fact sheets

### For Web/Digital
While these are high-resolution files, they can be resized for web use. For optimal web performance, consider creating lower-resolution versions (72-150 DPI) for digital-only distribution.
